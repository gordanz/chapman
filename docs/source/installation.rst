Installation
------------

To install :mod:`chapman` on your computer, open your terminal and type

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U chapman

If are in a cloud-based environment such as
`Google Collaboratory`_, use the following command in the notebook

.. code-block:: bash

    !pip install -U chapman

Make sure to use the -U flag. It will make sure you have the latest
version of the package (I will be fixing bugs as I find them).
chapman requires Python 3, so make sure that your pip does the
same thing as pip3.
